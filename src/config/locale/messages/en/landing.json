The trend started when users asked ChatGPT to create playful caricatures based on their photos and personal details. Our dedicated AI caricature generator takes this concept further — you get professional-quality caricature portraits from your photos without needing a ChatGPT Plus subscription."

        "question": "How does the AI caricature generator work?",
        "answer": "Upload a clear face photo, select one of our 9 caricature styles (Classic, Pro-Roast, 3D Cartoon, Comic, Chibi, Pop Art, Action Figure, Claymation, or South Park), optionally add your job title or hobbies, and click Create. Our AI analyzes your facial features — structure, expression, and proportions — then generates a personalized cartoon portrait in seconds."
      },
      {
        "question": "What photo works best for AI caricatures?",
        "answer": "A clear, well-lit face photo produces the best results. Front-facing portraits with even lighting give the most accurate and fun caricature output. Avoid group photos, heavy filters, sunglasses, or images where the face is partially obscured."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to create a caricature?",
        "answer": "Each caricature costs 20 credits. Start with our Credits Pack at $4.9 for 400 credits (20 caricatures), or subscribe to the monthly plan at $9.9/month for 500 credits (25 caricatures per month). Both options include full high-resolution downloads."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use my caricature for commercial purposes?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What caricature styles are available?",
        "answer": "We offer 9 distinct styles: Classic Caricature (traditional big-head with exaggerated features), Pro-Roast Job (profession-themed with work props), 3D Cartoon (Pixar/Disney-inspired), Comic Style (superhero comic book look), Chibi (cute anime proportions), Pop Art (bold colors inspired by Andy Warhol), Action Figure (collectible toy packaging), Claymation (Wallace & Gromit texture), and TV Satire - South Park (paper cutout)."

        "question": "How is this different from using ChatGPT directly?",
